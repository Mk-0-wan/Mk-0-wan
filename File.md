How cool to have learned c programming languages will be sharing a readme file which will try to explain each code in ".c" file
Hope you will find this helpful
First will start off with the stringTo2number.c file
Finally done with the simple shell project.
Having a break at the moment this is just to keep my git streaks alive
Done
